This is a collection of notes and quick-reference documents for the my learnings, so I can just run the file script and output the notes I'd included. 

## Setup
This repo is for my personal referene and practice, and it's relevant really only to my learning. But have at it, if you're interested. :-)

1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` into this directory
3. `chmod +x` on all files (or any you'd like to use)

## How to Use
1. `cd` into this directory
2. Run the file whose notes you want to see

That's it!

## Make it Your Own
I'm sure there are endless ways you could run with this, but to get you started:

* Create your own files with notes on what you would like for quick/easy reference.
* You could create an alias in your .zshrc to easily get you to this directory - and/or to run the file in question

## What You Won't Find Here
The files in this repo are meant to be notes for learning and quick reference. No processes here are automated. 

## Issues
None known.
